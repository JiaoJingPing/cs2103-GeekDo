=============
School project.
A Java  mini To-Do List.

Geekdo is a to-do manager that enables you to schedule and organise your tasks quickly and efficiently. Primarily aimed at geeks, it allows you to access all functionalities from the command line, although non-geeks will find Geekdo easy to use as well through the graphical user interface. No installation is required; simply run the .jar file. We recommend using Windows and Java SE 5 and above to enable all functionalities and
features of Geekdo.
